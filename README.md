## Roadmap

The authors would like to continue growing the community of users and get a UI that shows the evolution of Pokemon in a gif or something more accurate. We would also like to create more goals and eventually include a synchronization with Fitbit, Applewatch, and Samsungwatch.




## Contribution

Pokemon Fit is a growing community and with that in mind, we would love to accept more contributors' ideas and reviews.
